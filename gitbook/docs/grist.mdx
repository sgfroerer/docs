  <Accordion title="Check if grist-api is installed in Grist container" defaultOpen={false}>
    1️⃣ Open a Shell Inside the Container

    > Run this command to start an interactive shell session inside the Grist container:

    ```
    docker exec -it Grist sh
    ```

    > (If `sh` doesn't work, try `bash`:

    ```
    docker exec -it Grist bash
    ```

    > However, some lightweight containers might not have `bash` installed.)

    ### 2️⃣ Check If `grist-api` Exists

    > Once inside the container, try running:

    ```
    command -v grist-api
    ```

    > If it returns a path (`e.g.`, `/usr/local/bin/grist-api`), then grist-api is installed.
    > If there's no output, it's not installed.

    ### 3️⃣ Try Running It

    > You can also attempt to run it directly:

    ```
    grist-api --help
    ```

    > If the command exists, it should return usage instructions. Otherwise, you'll get a "command not found" error.
