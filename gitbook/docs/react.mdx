    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="1. Install Dependencies" defaultOpen={false}>
        <Tip>
          Since the app uses `pnpm`, you’ll need to install the dependencies first.
        </Tip>

        #### Install `pnpm` (if not installed already)

        Run this command to install `pnpm` globally:

        ```bash
        npm install -g pnpm
        ```

        #### Install the Project Dependencies

        Navigate to the root directory of the project and install dependencies:

        ```bash
        pnpm install
        ```
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="2. Run the React App (Development Mode)" defaultOpen={false}>
        To run the app in development mode (with hot reloading):

        ```bash
        pnpm dev
        ```

        By default, it will start the development server (typically on [http://localhost:3000]()).


      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="3. Build the React App (Production)" defaultOpen={false}>
        To build the React app into a static site:

        ```
        pnpm build
        ```

        This will generate a `dist` folder (or similar, depending on the `vite.config.ts` or `next.config.js` if it uses Vite/Next.js). Inside this folder, you'll find the static files ready to be served.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="4. Prepare the Files | static-web-server" defaultOpen={false}>
        Copy the contents of the `dist` folder into the `Public` folder of your `static-web-server` setup:

        ```bash
        cp -R dist/* Public/
        ```

        Your `Public` folder should now look like this:

        ```vbnet
        Public/
          ├── index.html
          ├── assets/
          └── other-static-files
        ```

        Update the `config.toml` file to include the `spa = true` setting if the React app uses client-side routing.


      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Serve the Built App" defaultOpen={false}>
        Run the `static-web-server` using Docker Compose or another method, as described earlier, to serve the built React app.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Additional Notes - Tailwind CSS & TypeScript" defaultOpen={false}>
        **Using Tailwind CSS**: Since your app uses `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`, ensure the `build` command processes your Tailwind styles correctly. This is usually handled automatically by Vite or CRA (Create React App), but verify your Tailwind setup in `package.json`



        **TypeScript**: The presence of `.tsx` files means you’re using TypeScript. Ensure there are no type errors before building by running:


        ```bash
        pnpm tsc --noEmit
        ```
