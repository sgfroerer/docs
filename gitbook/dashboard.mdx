# Charts & Components

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Last Call Segment" defaultOpen="false" icon="chart-pie">
    **Metric:** 

    - Bar/Donut chart showing distribution of owners across “Last Call Segment” values (e.g., 🗣️ Contact 🗣️, ✖️ No VM ✖️). 

    **Why:** 

    - Understanding how contacts are segmented based on engagement can help identify the effectiveness of outreach efforts and highlight which segment needs more attention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Property Portfolio Analysis" defaultOpen="false" icon="building">
    **Metric:** 

    - Map visualization with markers for properties grouped by locations (e.g., Salem, North Bend, Hillsboro). 

    **Why:** 

    - Visualizing the geographic distribution of properties provides insights into market coverage and helps identify areas with potential opportunities or overrepresentation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Age Demographics of Owners" defaultOpen="false" icon="children">
    **Metric:** 

    - Histogram or bar chart showing the age distribution of property owners (e.g., “Tranche” or “Age”). 

    **Why:** 

    - Age demographics can reveal patterns in investment or selling behavior and help tailor communication strategies for different age groups.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Engagement History" defaultOpen="false" icon="timeline">
    **Metric:** 

    - Timeline or heatmap of “Date” vs. “Past Contact?” 

    **Why:** 

    - This allows you to track historical contact frequency and identify periods of inactivity, enabling targeted follow-ups to maintain relationships.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Objection & Opportunity Analysis" defaultOpen="false" icon="table-list">
    **Metric:** 

    - Word cloud or frequency table of common objections and opportunities. 

    **Why:** 

    - Summarizing recurring objections (e.g., “Not Wanting Anything”) and opportunities helps refine the sales approach and prioritize key pain points or areas for potential growth.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Owner Engagement & Contact Status (Bar Chart or Pie Chart)" defaultOpen="false">
    **Why?** 

    - This will help visualize how many owners have been contacted, the status of those contacts, and their level of interest. Fields like

      **"Last_Call_Segment"**

      ,

      **"Past_Contact\_"**

      , and

      **"Segment"**

      (e.g., Not Interested, Never, Not Primary) can be used to categorize responses.

    **How to use it?** 

    - A pie chart can show the distribution of engagement status, while a bar chart can break it down further by segment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Properties by Type & Tenancy (Stacked Bar or Tree Map)" defaultOpen="false">
    **Why?** 

    - Understanding the mix of property types (e.g.,

      **"Freestanding Retail"**

      ,

      **"Auto Repair"**

      ) and their tenancy status (single vs. multi-tenant) can help focus marketing efforts.

    **How to use it?** 

    - A

      **stacked bar chart**

      can display the proportion of different property types, with tenancy status layered on top. A

      **tree map**

      can show property categories based on size (e.g., land area or rentable building area).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Owner Portfolio Size & Concentration (Histogram or Bubble Chart)" defaultOpen="false">
    **Why?** 

    - Some owners hold multiple properties (as seen in the

      **"Properties\_"**

      field), so visualizing the number of properties per owner can identify high-value prospects.

    **How to use it?** 

    - A

      **histogram**

      can show the frequency distribution of owners by property count. A

      **bubble chart**

      can display owners where bubble size represents the total value of properties owned.
