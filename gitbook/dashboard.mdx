    * Bar/Donut chart showing distribution of owners across “Last Call Segment” values (e.g., 🗣️ Contact 🗣️, ✖️ No VM ✖️).

    * Understanding how contacts are segmented based on engagement can help identify the effectiveness of outreach efforts and highlight which segment needs more attention.

  </Accordion>

    **Metric:** 

    * Map visualization with markers for properties grouped by locations (e.g., Salem, North Bend, Hillsboro). 

    **Why:** 

    * Visualizing the geographic distribution of properties provides insights into market coverage and helps identify areas with potential opportunities or overrepresentation.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Age Demographics of Owners" defaultOpen={false} icon="children">
    **Metric:** 

    * Histogram or bar chart showing the age distribution of property owners (e.g., “Tranche” or “Age”). 

    **Why:** 

    * Age demographics can reveal patterns in investment or selling behavior and help tailor communication strategies for different age groups.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Engagement History" defaultOpen={false} icon="timeline">
    **Metric:** 

    * Timeline or heatmap of “Date” vs. “Past Contact?” 

    **Why:** 

    * This allows you to track historical contact frequency and identify periods of inactivity, enabling targeted follow-ups to maintain relationships.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Objection & Opportunity Analysis" defaultOpen={false} icon="table-list">
    **Metric:** 

    * Word cloud or frequency table of common objections and opportunities. 

    **Why:** 

    * Summarizing recurring objections (e.g., “Not Wanting Anything”) and opportunities helps refine the sales approach and prioritize key pain points or areas for potential growth.
