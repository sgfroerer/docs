# **Shopping Center Report:**

Tom,

Finally got the report put together! This covers the recent trends, top transactions, and what buyers are prioritizing for the upcoming year.

You can view the report here: Retail Center - Sales Report
Shopping Center Report

Also, I’ve included a City Profile for Gresham, which gives a deeper look at local demographics and economic trends:
Gresham City Profile

Finally got to put that computer science minor to good use on this! Let me know if you'd like to discuss or go over anything in more detail—I’d be happy to chat.
