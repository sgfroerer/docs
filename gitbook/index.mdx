# **Shopping Center Report:**

[**Gresham**](https://data.census.gov/profile/Gresham_city,_Oregon?g=160XX00US4131250)

Tom,

Finally got the report put together! This covers the recent trends, top transactions, and what buyers are prioritizing for the upcoming year.

You can view the report here: Retail Center - Sales Report
Shopping Center Report

Also, I’ve included a City Profile for Gresham, which gives a deeper look at local demographics and economic trends:
Gresham City Profile

Finally got to put that computer science minor to good use on this! Let me know if you'd like to discuss or go over anything in more detail—I’d be happy to chat.

Hey Paul, this is Sam G with Marcus and Millichap (this is my cell). I just finished putting together an in-depth report on what the big institutional investors are focusing on going into 2025—recent transactions of shopping centers, buyer trends, and what’s in demand. I wanted to send it your way, but I don't have the correct email for you. What’s the best address to send it to?

Just sent him text for Shopping Center Report - asked for correct email
