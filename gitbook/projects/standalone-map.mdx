    websockets - Can we open a websocket with the server

    Websocket connections need HTTP 1.1 and the ability to pass a few extra headers     in order to work. Sometimes a reverse proxy can interfere with these requirements.
    url:
    ws://localhost:8484/

    I have custom map widgets that I use in Grist and they react to the records, like when I tap an owner, the map will go to their property, etc.  I've attached my third custom map project which I'm trying to make as a standalone map, that gets it's data from Grist > So can you make it so that this makes GET request's with grist-api to just get the records to use as data instead?
