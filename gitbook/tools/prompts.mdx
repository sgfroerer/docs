      # Grist-API
      Here are a few examples of use with the grist-api:
      - /docs/{docId}/tables/{tableId}/records
          - GET - Fetch records from a table
      - /docs/{docId}/tables/{tableId}/columns
          - GET - List columns in a table
      - /docs/{docId}/sql
          - GET - Run an SQL query against a document
      ---
      For my instance, 
      This fetches the records in my table titled "Properties":
      - http://localhost:8484/o/docs/api/docs/6627doqoUdusJLxaciaTXC/tables/Properties/records
      This does the same but for my table titled "Owners":
      - http://localhost:8484/o/docs/api/docs/6627doqoUdusJLxaciaTXC/tables/Owners/records
      For my local grist instance, 
      - My API Key is: c36a6046399de44226d26a9c328688882e20b63f
      - My Base URL to my document is: http://localhost:8484/o/docs/api/docs/6627doqoUdusJLxaciaTXC
      - My Document_ID or "docId" is: 6627doqoUdusJLxaciaTXC

      I use Grist as a CRM with two tables, one for property owners and one for the properties. The Custom Widget Builder allows you to build custom widgets with HTML and JavaScript, right inside Grist. 

      Here is the code view for my owners table so you can see what the column names and types are:
      # Owners_:

    ```
    Add a Daily tab that shows visuals that filter owners by date column being (today) relative to whatever day it is. This can be how many Calls, (how many times (segment) or (last call segment) was changed today), a breakdown of last call segment and owner personality, etc. For today it should just check the data column, if the date in the column is =TODAY() then that counts as a call. 

    Please do more visuals for location/property based visuals too, like a map of oregon that shows different shaded areas depending on if the owners of the properties in that area I talked to already, maybe shaded purple for properties owned by "IPA" in classify column, shaded green for owners I've never spoken with, etc.

    Can you make a tab for owner visuals so as a broker I can see how many i have contacted, haven't contacted, show the different columns like classify or segment or how many are buy in activity column, etc.

    ```markdown
    I’d like to achieve the following improvements:

    1. **Design Modernization**: Rewrite the pop-up layout to use **Tailwind CSS** for a sleek, responsive design with utility classes. For example:
        - Use `flex` and `grid` for better alignment.
        - Add hover effects for buttons.
        - Use rounded corners and shadows for a card-like design.
    2. **Enhanced Functionality**: Add dynamic features, such as collapsible sections for tenant lists or tooltips for buttons.
    3. **Minimize White Space**: Reduce padding and space between elements to make the design more compact while maintaining readability.
    4. **Optional Features**: If there are any external libraries (like **Tailwind CSS, or Popover.js**) that could enhance interactivity or aesthetics, feel free to suggest or implement them.
    5. **Image Handling**: Ensure images are displayed elegantly (e.g., as thumbnails with a lightbox preview on click) or use placeholders if no image is available.

    Please provide a code rewrite that incorporates these improvements and explains how to integrate it into the map.

  <Accordion title="This is the prompt I gave chatGPT" defaultOpen={false}>
    ```
    This is the prompt I gave chatGPT: I use Grist as a CRM, and have made several custom widgets that I host in a GitHub repo. I am trying to get this map widget working, I have two separate folders/projects/widgets for the map widget as I tried different functionality and such. These two are Dropbox-Embed and Grist-GIS. I've attached both of their JavaScript files so you can see what works great in one that is lacking in the other. (I've titled the JavaScript files by their names rather than "page.js"). Here is a breakdown of what either of them do well and poorly: 

    Grist-GIS

    - Does have working Search
    - Does have working Change base Layer functionality
    - Google MyMaps mini-map is synced to main Map
    - Only shows around 1,320 properties

    Dropbox-Embed

    - Source control under map, scrollable
    - No search
    - No base layer changer
    - Shows all 10,000+ properties correctly

    I took it's output and created the "SearchBar-Map" as the combined one to isolate it as I try to properly merge the map widgets. Please fix searchbar-map and get it to work properly.
    Here was the last prompt I was going to give chatgpt before just moving the folders in here to ask you:
    The map doesn't load now, but the buttons in the corners still show up.  Am I supposed to change anything in the other files ?

    This is from the console:

  ##### Developers

  - Power tools - Take it to the next level with our [open-source](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core) spreadsheet-database tool.
  - Super-charged formulas
  	- Fully supports Python syntax and standard library in formulas.
  	- Includes many familiar Excel functions.
  - Extensible
  	- Connect to anything via REST API, webhooks, or integrators.
  	- Create your own custom widgets.
  - Unprecedented control
  	- Can be self-managed, for intranet operation or compliance.
  	- Uses SQLite format, great for portability and backups.
  - Built-in drag-and-drop dashboards, support for custom-coded views, Python formulas, and more.
  - Easily input data in a familiar spreadsheet UI, all while maintaining a relational SQLite file.
  - Link data visually in productive layouts that streamline your team’s workflows.

  ### Python formulas + Excel-like functions
  - Grist’s formula language is Python – a data scientist favorite with a robust library and intuitive syntax.
  - Don’t know Python? The internet is ready to teach you, as is [our community](https://community.getgrist.com/).
  - Got SUM() and AVERAGE() in muscle memory? We’ve got you; use many Excel-style functions.

  ### Take your data everywhere
  - Download Grist spreadsheets as SQLite files — a widely-used database, favored even by the [US Library of Congress!](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000461.shtml)
  - Use Grist everywhere: as a hosted service, in corporate networks, old desktops, CI tests, open-source projects, or even CDN-backed websites viewed by millions!
  - Use the [Grist CSV Viewer](https://www.getgrist.com/grist-csv-viewer/) to let your users preview and interact with CSV files hosted on your website, without downloading them.
  - Data portability and autonomy is in our open source DNA. Harness Grist’s power to build bespoke solutions for your team.

  ### Collaborate on your data your way
  - Write custom widgets in HTML/CSS/JS to suit your team’s needs.
  - Share one copy of data with granular permissions, controlling read/write access down to each cell.
  - Build custom data views with standard widgets, including [Grist calendar](https://www.getgrist.com/calendar/).
  - Set rules by role, limiting who can see what, from CEO to intern.

  ### More features
  - **Version control and backups**  `Developers used to git will enjoy the ability to do three-way comparisons and find common ancestors.`
  - **A powerful API**  `Access and edit your data and the structure of your spreadsheets, workspaces, and sites.`
  - **Incremental imports**  `Grist lets you import data, then import the next version of it in a sensible way.`

  ### These are some of the bigger features that landed in 2024:
  - **Admin console** **for self-hosters** – There is now an [ever-expanding admin console](https://support.getgrist.com/newsletters/2024-05/#self-hosting-admin-console-improvements) to help _console admins_ (sorry).
  - **Cumulative functions** – it turns out Grist’s unique structure uniquely benefits from a comprehensive set of [cumulative functions](https://support.getgrist.com/newsletters/2024-07/#cumulative-functions-previous-next-and-rank) (`PREV()` & `RANK()`) and `find` methods.
  - **[Two-way references](https://support.getgrist.com/col-refs/#two-way-references)** – a feature that required a _lot_ of plumbing, but adds a lot of flexibility to Grist’s relational nature. As they say, two ways are better than one!
  - You can now use [**rich formatting via Markdown**](https://support.getgrist.com/newsletters/2024-08/#markdown-cell-formatting) within text columns. _**Nice.**_
  - It’s now easier than ever to [**add custom widgets to the built-in list**](https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/#how-do-i-list-custom-widgets) in self-hosted installations. Want to be included in the main gallery, [let us know](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-2024-year-in-review/#gallery)!
  - Our new [**custom widget builder custom widget**](https://community.getgrist.com/t/new-community-widget-custom-widget-builder/6803) may indeed be a major feature, as we’ve already seen several [advanced widgets](https://community.getgrist.com/t/tutorial-building-santas-workshop-dashboard-with-custom-widget-builder-a-step-by-step-guide-to-advanced-visualization-in-grist/7478) making use of the very meta tool with a mouthful of a name.

      On their github for Usage Example of the grist-api, (NodeJS client for interacting with Grist), they provide this template:
      Installation
      npm install grist-api
      Usage Example
      const {GristDocAPI} = require('grist-api');

      // Put here the URL of your document.
      const DOC_URL = "https://docs.getgrist.com/123456789abc/My-Document";

      async function main() {
        const api = new GristDocAPI(DOC_URL);
        // Add some rows to a table
        await api.addRecords('Food', [
          {Name: 'eggs', AmountToBuy: 12},
          {Name: 'beets', AmountToBuy: 1},
        ]);

        // Fetch all rows.
        const data = await api.fetchTable('Food');
        console.log(data);

        // Sync data by a key column.
        await api.syncTable('Food', [{Name: 'eggs', AmountToBuy: 0}], ['Name']);
      }

      main();
      To run this, first prepare a Grist doc to play with:

      Create a Grist doc
      Add a table named Food with columns Name and AmountToBuy
      Set DOC_URL in the code above to that of your document (the part after doc ID doesn't matter).
      To use the API, you need to get your API key in Grist from Profile Settings. This API key may be provided to GristDocAPI in several ways, and is looked for in this order:

      As a constructor argument: new GristDocAPI(DOC_URL, {apiKey: 'XXX'}).
      In an environment variable: GRIST_API_KEY=<key>.
      In the ~/.grist-api-key file.
      Public documents may be accessed without an API key, or with an empty string for the API key (to stop searching the locations above).

      Classes and methods
      new GristDocAPI(docUrlOrId, options)
      Create an API instance. You may specify either a doc URL, or just the doc ID (the part of the URL after "/doc/"). If you specify a URL, then options.server is unneeded and ignored.

      The options are:

      apiKey (string) The API key, available in Grist from Profile Settings. If omitted, will be taken from GRIST_API_KEY env var, or ~/.grist-api-key file.
      server (string) The server URL, i.e. the part of the document URL before "/doc/". Ignored if you specify a full URL for the first argument.
      dryrun (boolean) If set, will not make any changes to the doc. You may run with DEBUG=grist-api to see what calls it would make.
      chunkSize (number, default: 500) Split large requests into smaller one, each limited to chunkSize rows. If your requests are very large and hit size limits, try using a smaller value.
      fetchTable(tableName, filters?)
      Fetch all data in the table by the given name, returning a list of records with attributes corresponding to the columns in that table.

      If filters is given, it should be an object mapping column names to array values, to fetch only records that match. For example {Name: ['eggs']}.

      addRecords(tableName, records)
      Adds new records to the given table. The data is a list of objects, with attributes corresponding to the columns in the table. Returns a list of added rowIds.

      deleteRecords(tableName, recordIds)
      Deletes records from the given table. The data is a list of record IDs.

      updateRecords(tableName, records)
      Update existing records in the given table. The data is a list of objects, with attributes corresponding to the columns in the table. Each object must contain the key "id" with the rowId of the row to update.

      If records aren't all for the same set of columns, then a single-call update is impossible, so we'll make multiple calls.

      syncTable(tableName, records, keyColIds, {filters?})
      Updates Grist table with new data, updating existing rows or adding new ones, matching rows on the given key columns. (This method does not remove rows from Grist.)

      The records parameter is a list of objects with column IDs as attributes.

      The keyColIds parameter lists primary-key columns, which must be present in the given records.

      If options.filters is given, it should be an object mapping colIds to arrays of values. Only records matching these filters will be matched as candidates for existing rows to update. New records whose columns don't match filters will be ignored.

  <Accordion title="5 Key Data Visualizations" defaultOpen={false}>
    ### 1. **Contact Segments Breakdown**

    **Metric:** Bar/Donut chart showing distribution of owners across "Last Call Segment" values (e.g., 🗣️ Contact 🗣️, ✖️ No VM ✖️).
    **Why:**
    Understanding how contacts are segmented based on engagement can help identify the effectiveness of outreach efforts and highlight which segment needs more attention.

    ***

    ### 2. **Property Portfolio Analysis**

    **Metric:** Map visualization with markers for properties grouped by locations (e.g., Salem, North Bend, Hillsboro).
    **Why:**
    Visualizing the geographic distribution of properties provides insights into market coverage and helps identify areas with potential opportunities or overrepresentation.

    ***

    ### 3. **Age Demographics of Owners**

    **Metric:** Histogram or bar chart showing the age distribution of property owners (e.g., "Tranche" or "Age").
    **Why:**
    Age demographics can reveal patterns in investment or selling behavior and help tailor communication strategies for different age groups.

    ***

    ### 4. **Engagement History**

    **Metric:** Timeline or heatmap of "Date" vs. "Past Contact?"
    **Why:**
    This allows you to track historical contact frequency and identify periods of inactivity, enabling targeted follow-ups to maintain relationships.

    ***

    ### 5. **Objection and Opportunity Analysis**

    **Metric:** Word cloud or frequency table of common objections and opportunities.
    **Why:**
    Summarizing recurring objections (e.g., "Not Wanting Anything") and opportunities helps refine the sales approach and prioritize key pain points or areas for potential growth.

    ***

    ### Bonus Metrics (Optional):

    * **"Plans to Buy" vs. "Plans to Sell" Trends:**

      Stacked bar chart to track buying and selling intentions over time.

    * **Property Tenancy Summary:**

      List or table highlighting properties with tenants (e.g., Safeway, Joann Fabrics).

  <Accordion title="Create Dashboard" defaultOpen={false}>
    ```
    Now, I want you to create an interactive sales performance dashboard with the five key visualizations using HTML and JavaScript. Use the latest version of Plotly.js CDN and include an upload feature so that we can upload the JSON file. It should generate the dashboard based on the uploaded data.
    Note: I need to upload the sales data from my local computer, and it should create the dashboard based on that data.

    I have a github repo where I have different folders with different apps/projects/custom widgets/etc. It is hosted with github pages. The custom widgets are for Grist, that interact with the data in Grist. There are also custom map widgets with popups and functionality as well as standalone map applications. I also have a folder called geojson that stores different geojson files which the standalone maps get the data from. 

    My current main index page is old and looks horrible, just a green bar at the top with the title and then a bunch of white cards with one green button. The functionality is great, being able to preview the project in a window down below the cards, and also clicking on the name of the project to go to the hosted page. Please update and improve this index.html page for my github repository. 

    There are three groups of project types: Grist Widgets, Maps, Dashboard, and also the geojson folder. I made a google sheet with each project I currently have, a column for if it's working or not, what group it's in, and a note/description of it. Please reference and use as you create the new index.html file:
