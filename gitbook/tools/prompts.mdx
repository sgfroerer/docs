      I use Grist as a CRM with two tables, one for property owners and one for the properties. The Custom Widget Builder allows you to build custom widgets with HTML and JavaScript, right inside Grist. 

      Here is the code view for my owners table so you can see what the column names and types are:
      ## Owners_:
      Call_Relationship = grist.ChoiceList() 
      Constant_Call_VM_s = grist.Bool()
