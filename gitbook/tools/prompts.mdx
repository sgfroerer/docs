      # Grist-API
      Here are a few examples of use with the grist-api:
      - /docs/{docId}/tables/{tableId}/records
          - GET - Fetch records from a table
      - /docs/{docId}/tables/{tableId}/columns
          - GET - List columns in a table
      - /docs/{docId}/sql
          - GET - Run an SQL query against a document
      ---
      For my instance, 
      This fetches the records in my table titled "Properties":
      - http://localhost:8484/o/docs/api/docs/6627doqoUdusJLxaciaTXC/tables/Properties/records
      This does the same but for my table titled "Owners":
      - http://localhost:8484/o/docs/api/docs/6627doqoUdusJLxaciaTXC/tables/Owners/records
      For my local grist instance, 
      - My API Key is: c36a6046399de44226d26a9c328688882e20b63f
      - My Base URL to my document is: http://localhost:8484/o/docs/api/docs/6627doqoUdusJLxaciaTXC
      - My Document_ID or "docId" is: 6627doqoUdusJLxaciaTXC

      I use Grist as a CRM with two tables, one for property owners and one for the properties. The Custom Widget Builder allows you to build custom widgets with HTML and JavaScript, right inside Grist. 

      Here is the code view for my owners table so you can see what the column names and types are:

  <Accordion title="Daily Tab & Owner Visuals " defaultOpen={false}>
    a

    ```
    Add a Daily tab that shows visuals that filter owners by date column being (today) relative to whatever day it is. This can be how many Calls, (how many times (segment) or (last call segment) was changed today), a breakdown of last call segment and owner personality, etc. For today it should just check the data column, if the date in the column is =TODAY() then that counts as a call. 

    Please do more visuals for location/property based visuals too, like a map of oregon that shows different shaded areas depending on if the owners of the properties in that area I talked to already, maybe shaded purple for properties owned by "IPA" in classify column, shaded green for owners I've never spoken with, etc.

    Can you make a tab for owner visuals so as a broker I can see how many i have contacted, haven't contacted, show the different columns like classify or segment or how many are buy in activity column, etc.
