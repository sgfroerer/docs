    Please optimize this prompt:

    ```
    I am a commercial real estate broker that specializes in Retail properties. I want to create an app for organizing and seeing all on-markets that I can add. I track all properties for sale in my market that I upload as a csv each week. I also track ones that may be expiring soon and have been on market for 180+ days. I want it to be a very intuitive and clean/modern design, visually appealing with different views like card gallery and kanban. I want to easily filter and sort through the on-markets so I can pull up information about and talk about some of them while I'm on phone calls with buyers. 
    An idea for this Listings/On-Markets project is also that I could sort by STNL, Multi tenant, Centers, Off-Markets, properties I've done Proposals on that would consider looking at offers, "Bring me an offer", Soon to Expire, etc.

    I would like to better match owners in my crm that tell me what they are looking to buy, to properties that come on market for sale that matches their criteria. Here are some other ideas:


    Tracking Expiring Listings:

    - Add a "Countdown to Expiration" field that calculates the days remaining before a listing expires, helping you focus on soon-to-expire opportunities.
    - Set alerts or color-code properties that are about to expire, so you can target them for potential proposals or off-market opportunities.
    ```
